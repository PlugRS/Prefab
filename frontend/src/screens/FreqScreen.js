      <h3>Frequently Asked Questions</h3>
      <h5>
        <strong>What are Pods?</strong>
      </h5>
      <h6>
        A pod is a factory-made unit for utilities like Toilet, Office, Gym
        etc., which is fully fitted and plumbed, delivered to the construction
        site, and ready to use. The on-site crews simply connect the pods to the
        main mechanical, electrical and plumbing systems in the corridors and
        pods above/below.
      </h6>
      <br />
      <h5>
        <strong>Can I Customise Pods?</strong>
      </h5>
      <h6>
        Yes, you can! It depends on sellers if they can build custom pods
        (Custom size, features etc. ) otherwise if the interior decoration is
        concerned then every seller provides this service.

      <h5>
        <strong>What are prefab Homes?</strong>
      </h5>
      <h6>
        Prefabricated homes, often referred to as prefab homes or simply
        prefabs, are manufactured off-site in advance, usually in standard
        sections that can be easily shipped and assembled. Below are the
        examples: - Modular homes are created in sections and then transported
        to the home site for construction and installation. Treated like normal
        homes, they can be made of Panels, SIP, Wood or Steel depending on the
        Seller. - Manufactured homes are built onto steel beams, and are
        transported incomplete sections to the home site, where they are
        assembled. - Mobile homes, or trailers, are built on wheels and can be
        pulled by a vehicle. - Unconventional Home Units such as bamboo,
        ferrocement &amp; mud homes will also be included after proper
        verification in future.
